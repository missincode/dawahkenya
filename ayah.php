       <p><b>Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:</b><p>
<b>The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said,</b><p> 
<h2><i><q>On every joint of man, there is charity, on everyday when the sun rises: doing justice between two men is charity, and assisting a man to ride an animal or to load his luggage on it is charity; and a good word is charity, every step which one takes towards (the mosque for) Salat is charity, and removing harmful things from the way is charity</q></i></h2>.

    <p><h5><i><q>O ye who believe! cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury,- like those who spend their substance to be seen of men, but believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day.They are in parable like a hard, barren rock, on which is a little soil: on it falls heavy rain, which leaves it (Just) a bare stone.They will be able to do nothing with aught they have earned.And Allah guideth not those who reject faith. </q></i></h5>
